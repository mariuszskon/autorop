    """Leak libc addresses using a leaking function.

    This function leaks the libc addresses of ``symbols``
    using rop chain built by ``leaker``, placing them in ``state.leaks``.
    ``leaker`` msut separate leaks using newlines.

    Arguments:
        state: The current ``PwnState`` with the following set

            - ``target_factory``: Producer of target to exploit.
            - ``_elf``: pwntools ``ELF`` of ``state.binary_name``.
            - ``overwriter``: Function which writes rop chain to the "right place".
            - ``vuln_function``: Name of vulnerable function in binary,
              which we can return to repeatedly.

        leaker: function which reads arbitrary memory, newline terminated.
        symbols: what libc symbols we need to leak.
        offset: offset, in bytes, from the start of the GOT address of each symbol
                at which to begin leak, treating previous bytes as zeroes
                (this is helpful if the leaker function terminates on a zero byte)

    Returns:
        Mutated ``PwnState``, with the following updated

            - ``target``: The instance of target from which we got a successful leak.
              Hopefully it can still be interacted with.
            - ``leaks``: Updated with ``"symbol": address`` pairs for each
              function address of libc that was leaked.
