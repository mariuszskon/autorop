    """Perform a "classic" attack against a binary.

    Launch a find-leak-lookup-shell attack against a binary.
    I made up this term.
    But it is a common pattern in CTFs.

    - Find: Find the vulnerability (e.g. how far we need to write to overwrite
      return address due to a buffer overflow).
    - Leak: Find out important stuff about our context (e.g. addresses of
      symbols in libc, PIE offset, etc.).
    - Lookup: Get data from elsewhere (e.g. download appropriate libc version).
    - Shell: Spawn a shell (e.g. via ret2libc, or via syscall).

    The default parameters perform a ret2libc attack on a non-PIE/non-ASLR target
    (at most one of these is fine, but not both), leaking with ``puts``.
    You can set ``state.elf.address`` yourself and it might work for PIE and ASLR.
    We use `libc-database <https://github.com/niklasb/libc-database>`_ to find the libc, and then spawn a shell on the target.

    Arguments:
        find: "Finder" of vulnerability. :mod:`autorop.bof` may be of interest.
        leak: "Leaker". :mod:`autorop.leak` may be of interest.
        lookup: "Lookup-er" of info. :mod:`autorop.libc` may be of interest.
        shell: Spawner of shell. :mod:`autorop.call` may be of interest.

    Returns:
        Function which takes a ``PwnState``, and returns the new ``PwnState``.
